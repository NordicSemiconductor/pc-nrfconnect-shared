## 4.28.1 - 2021-06-24
### Changed
- Increase padding for `Card` component.

## 4.28.0 - 2021-06-21
### Changed
- Pin the version of prettier to be used to an exact version, as
  [recommended in the prettier documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html).
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- If you are using an older prettier version than 2.3.0, upgrading to this
  version of shared can likely cause linting to fail due to formatting errors.
  The majority of these can be fixed automatically, by running
  `npm run lint -- --fix`.

## 4.27.3 - 2021-06-21
### Fixed
- Exported `colors` object was empty.

## 4.27.2 - 2021-06-15
### Fixed
- GA events were sent even when the user had not consented.
- `Restore defaults` button styling inside `ErrorBoundary` component was broken.

## 4.27.1 - 2021-06-14
### Changed
- Small change to tooltip background color and opacity.

## 4.27.0 - 2021-06-14
### Changed
- Use `Card` component introduced in 4.22.0 in the `About` pane.

## 4.26.0 - 2021-06-08
### Changed
- Upgrade several webpack related dependencies.
- Upgrade systeminformation, which had a security issue.
### Fixed
- The system report generated from the about pane only contained `[object Promise]`.
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- eslint-loader was removed because it is deprecated. If you have a webpack
  config that still uses it, either install it yourself or (better) switch
  to eslint-webpack-plugin.

## 4.25.0 - 2021-06-07
### Fixed
- Remove namespace pollution by `Card` component, which broke the layout of the
  Toolchain Manager.
### Changed
- This version enables CSS modules. To use them, the CSS filename needs to
  include `.module.` and you need to import that CSS file and use its content
  in your JSX files as you can see in the `Card` component.

## 4.24.0
### Added
- Component `FactoryResetButton`. This component is also added to the `About` pane.

## 4.23.1
### Changed
- Allow overriding GA reporting and restore default functionality in `ErrorBoundary`
  component.

## 4.23.0
### Added
- Error robustness
  - Added a component `ErrorBoundary` which can be used as an
    [Error Boundary](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html): When an
    error happens inside the enclosed components, users are presented with tools
    for recovery.
  - Use the `ErrorBoundary` for all apps using the component `App`, so these
    usually do not need to use this error boundary explicitly.

## 4.22.2
### Fixed
- Type of `Toggle` props were slightly wrong.

## 4.22.1
### Fixed
- Wrong current pane could crash the app: E.g. when an app previously had four
  panes, it was persisted that the user was previously on the last pane and a
  new release of the app has just a single pane then the app crashes when that
  user opens the app again.

## 4.22.0
### Added
- Component `Card`.

## 4.21.1
### Fixed
- Exported colors were missing definitions for `black` and `white`.
- The build scripts did not return a non-zero exit status on build errors.

## 4.21.0
### Added
- Property `reportUsageData` to component App.
- Function `getPersistentStore` to get a persistent store, specific for the
  app. The app name from `package.json` is used to identify the app.
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- If your app wants to report usage data, you can remove the code to call
  `usageData.init()` and instead set the property `reportUsageData` to the
  component `App`.
- If your app already use a persistent store, you can switch to
  `getPersistentStore()`, just be aware that if you currently use a different
  name for the store than the app name from `package.json`, then the old
  settings are either lost of you have to care for migrating them.

## 4.20.0
### Changed
- Extended type definition `PackageJson`.
### Added
- Allow different side panels per pane. If a pane should show a special side
  panel it can be defined in the list of panes. If no side panel is defined for
  a pane, the general side panel defined for the whole app is used. E.g. in an
  app defined like the following on the pane Dashboard (and also the pane About)
  the normal `SidePanel` component is shown, while on the pane Terminal the
  `TerminalSidePanel` is shown.
  ```jsx
  <App
    sidePanel={<SidePanel />}
    panes={[
      {
        name: 'Dashboard',
        Main: Dashboard,
      },
      {
        name: 'Terminal',
        Main: Terminal
        SidePanel: TerminalSidePanel,
      },
    ]}
  />
  ```

## 4.19.0
### Added
- Shared styles can now be imported in SCSS from
  `~pc-nrfconnect-shared/styles`.
- When users start an app, the pane is opened again, that was open
  when they left the app the last time. Only the about pane is ignored,
  because we assume people are not interested in returning to the about
  pane.
### Changed
- Types for the exported colors got more specific.
- The format for specifying the panes of the app as a property to the
  `App` component has changed. See below for details.
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- If you had an import like
  ```scss
  @import '~pc-nrfconnect-shared/src/variables';
  ```
  in your SCSS code before, you should replace it with
  ```scss
  @import "~pc-nrfconnect-shared/styles";
  ```
  because even though for now the code with
  `~pc-nrfconnect-shared/src/variables` will keep on working, it is
  not part of the public API that we try to preserve. Contrary to
  `~pc-nrfconnect-shared/styles`, which is part of the supported API.
- Previously panes were defined as a pair of pane name and component,
  like this:
  ```js
  panes={[
    ['Dashboard', Dashboard],
    ['Terminal', Terminal],
  ]}
  ```
  This was changed to an array of objects, like this:
  ```js
  panes={[
    { name: 'Dashboard', Main: Dashboard, },
    { name: 'Terminal', Main: Terminal, },
  ]}
  ```
  The old format still is supported but will issue a warning and will
  be removed in the future.

## 4.18.0
### Changed
- Updated functions in the `usageData` object for sending usage data to
  Google Analytics.
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- When you are using `usageData`:
  - Change the parameter when calling `init`.
  - Replace calls to `sendEvent` with `sendUsageData`.

## 4.17.3
### Fixed
- Property `active` was missing in the TypeScript definition of the pane
  components.

## 4.17.2
### Fixed
- Not defining an app reducer led to an error.

## 4.17.1
### Changed
- Updated nRF5340 links from PDK to DK.

## 4.17.0
### Added
- Currently active pane: Selector `currentPane` to query it and action creator
  `setCurrentPane` to change it.
### Fixed
- When clicking on URLs in log entries the web site was not opened on macOS.
### Changed
- Add links to product page and distributors for the PPK2.
- Check stricter order of the imports during linting.
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- The stricter check for order of the imports while linting will probably
  make your linting fail after upgrading. So it is recommended to run
  `npm run lint -- --fix` once after updating, checking all the changes (most
  will be ok but there are very seldom cases where order is important like in
  `test/setupTests.js` in this project) and then commit all these small order
  changes.

## 4.16.1
### Fixed
- The opacity of disabled elements stacked up when they were nested. E.g.
  in the following code the input had the opacity applied twice (making the
  opacity squared), so it looked lighter than than supposed:
  ```html
    <div className="disabled">
      This
      <InlineInput disabled value="doubled">
    </div>
  ```
## 4.16.0
### Added
- The components `Slider`, `InlineInput` and `NumberInlineInput` now take a
  property `disabled`.
- All other elements can also be rendered to have a disabled (opaque) look by
  adding the class name `disabled` to them. This does only change the look, not
  their behaviour.
- A convenience function `classNames` can be used to construct compound class
  names. It filters out all values that are not strings. The idea of this
  function is to use it with conditionals and potentially unset values like
  this:
  ```js
  classNames(
    'fixed-class-name',
    isVisible && 'visible',
    isEnabled ? 'enabled' : 'disabled',
    potentiallyUndefined,
  )
  ```
- Set a property `active` on all rendered panes that is only for the currently
  active `true` and `false` for all others. This can be used to disable
  rendering of expensive components on inactive panes or to trigger effects
  when a pane gets activated or deactivated like this:
  ```js
  useEffect(() => {
    if (active) {
      // do stuff on activation
      return () => {
        // do stuff on deactivation
      }
    }
  }, [active])
  ```
- The component `Slider` now takes a property `ticks` to display ticks at all
  possible values. This only looks reasonable if there are just a few possible
  values.
### Changed
- Adapt the styling of disabled `Sliders` and alike also for the `Toggle`
  component.
- Components `InlineInput` and `NumberInlineInput` grow and shrink depending
  on their current content.
### Fixed
- Call the `onChangeComplete` on the component `NumberInlineInput` with the
  current value as a number, not as a string as it was before.

## 4.15.0
### Added
- New components `SidePanel`, `Group` and `CollapsibleGroup`
  which one can use in an app's implementation of a side panel.
- New hook `useHotKey` to register a hotkey for an action. It is automatically
  removed when the component is unmounted.
### Changed
- The default margin at the top and bottom of the side panel is removed.
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- When upgrading to this version it is recommended that apps start using the
  new components `SidePanel`, `Group` and `CollapsibleGroup` to implement
  their side panel, which will automatically take care of the removed top and
  bottom margins. If you prefer to implement a side panel without them, then
  you should check whether you add appropriate margins yourself.

## 4.14.4
### Changed
- Revert change from 4.14.2: Enable `import/no-cycle` ESLint rule again.

## 4.14.3
### Changed
- Pin `eslint-plugin-import` version.

## 4.14.2
### Changed
- Disabled `import/no-cycle` ESLint rule.

## 4.14.1
### Fixed
- Fixed fail to upload Changelog.md to server.

## 4.14.0
### Added
- Enable automatically selecting a specified device when it is detected in an
  app. To use this, set the environment variable `AUTOSELECT_DEVICE`, e.g. by
  running the launcher with
  ```
  AUTOSELECT_DEVICE=000680407810 npm run app
  ```
  the device with the serial number 000680407810 is automatically selected
  when apps using the new architecture see it for the first time. When one
  deselects the device it is not automatically selected again. After
  restarting the app, the device is automatically selected again.

## 4.13.0
### Changed
- Replaced moment.js with date-fns library.

## 4.12.0
### Added
- Support title property in Slider and Toggle.
### Changed
- Enhance lint configuration by specifying it in `package.json`.

## 4.11.0
### Added
- Added icon for a PPK.

## 4.10.4
### Changed
- Added `currentPane` field to `appLayout` type.

## 4.10.3
### Changed
- Added `iface en0` for looking up IP address on macOS.

## 4.10.2
### Changed
- Added persistent store for usage data settings in `shared` instead of in `launcher`.

## 4.10.1
### Changed
- Updated from v4.9.8 due to breaking changes in 4.10.0.

## 4.10.0
### Added
- Enable showing an own icon and links on the About pane for USB connected
  devices.
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- This version does introduce a first file in `shared` that is converted from
  JavaScript to TypeScript: `deviceInfo`. While most is already prepared for
  that, the `webpack.config.js` in the launcher still needs two adjustments to
  work with this: The lines
  [39](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-launcher/blob/497c1fde51246e1a4fcbc9efbb595d6764a7e056/webpack.config.js#L39)
  and
  [69](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-launcher/blob/497c1fde51246e1a4fcbc9efbb595d6764a7e056/webpack.config.js#L69)
  needs to be changed, so that webpack does not only pick up files with the
  ending `.jsx?` but also `.tsx?`. Apps, on the other hand, do not need to be
  changed for this.

## 4.9.8
### Changed
- Updated logic to decide which network interface to use to generate client id.

## 4.9.7
### Changed
- Updated how client is generated for usage statistics.

## 4.9.6
### Added
- Added optional range.decimals to be validated for NumberInlineInput.
- Updated index.d.ts with rangeShape.

## 4.9.5
### Fixed
- More type enhancements:
  - Correct `systemReport` signature.
  - Limit array types to readonly where possible.
  - Do not use void as a callback return value.
- Make linting fail if the type check fails.
- Remove conflicting ESLint rule 'quotes'.
- Lint all JavaScript files in this project, not just the ones in src/.

## 4.9.4
### Fixed
- Fix app's dependencies in webpack config.

## 4.9.3
### Added
- Added focus-visible dependency and disabled focus styles when clicked.

## 4.9.2
### Fixed
- Some types.

## 4.9.1
### Fixed
- Relax ESLint rule regarding @ts-ignore comments.

## 4.9.0
### Added
- Default `tsconfig.json` for other projects to use.
- Additional checks during linting:
  - Check for a `tsconfig.json` if the project uses TypeScript (if there are
    any files with the endings `.ts` or `.tsx`).
  - Run `tsc --noEmit` if there is a `tsconfig.json` to check the TypeScript
    types.
### Fixed
- Type error in bleChannels.
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- If you want to use the settings from `config/tsconfig.json` in a
  TypeScript project, then put this into a `tsconfig.json` in the
  root of your project:
  ```json
  {
    "extends": "./node_modules/pc-nrfconnect-shared/config/tsconfig.json",
  }
  ```
  Please note that `tsconfig.json` is _not_ used for the compilation of your
  project. We use the TypeScript transform plugin of babel for compilation and
  [that does not use the settings from
  `tsconfig.json`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-plugin-transform-typescript.html#caveats).
  But the settings in `tsconfig.json` are useful nonetheless, because they
  respected by many IDEs and editors as well as when you run `tsc`.

  If you want to override any settings from the default `tsconfig.json` you
  are free to do so. We put `strict` on `true` in there because that is what
  we aim for but you may want to relax that a bit when transitioning existing
  projects.

## 4.8.19
### Fixed
- Version number for 4.8.18 release was wrong in `package.json`.

## 4.8.18
### Changed
- Added `prettier.config.js` to existing script `npm run lint-init`.

## 4.8.17
### Changed
- New design, device selector: Add PCA number, better alignment for port names,
  removed wrong line below port names.

## 4.8.16
## Added
- Added support for files written in TypeScript.
- Added Prettier formatting.

### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- Note that apps using this version should add the following entry to their `package.json` file:
  ```json
  { "prettier": "./node_modules/pc-nrfconnect-shared/config/prettier.config.js" }
  ```
  If this isn't added, the Prettier defaults will be used, which differ from our style choices
  in a number of ways.

  On first run, the linting is likely to fail due to the prevalence of formatting errors.
  The majority of these can be fixed automatically, by running `npm run lint -- --fix`.

## 4.8.15
### Added
- Added onChangeComplete to InlineInput and NumberInlineInput.

## 4.8.14
### Fixed
- Restyle device selector.
- Fix scrollbars for old apps.

## 4.8.13
### Added
- Added optional chars prop to define number of characters of NumberInput.
- Added optional decimals prop to range of Slider.

## 4.8.12
### Fixed
- Fixed the Toggle components state in case it's controlled from outside.

## 4.8.11
### Fixed
- Fixed the fix of installation failure in local apps.

## 4.8.10
### Added
- Added toggle component.

## 4.8.9
### Changed
- Updated several design elements for the release of the new RSSI app.
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- Apps using the new design need to be adapted in areas were a scrollbar might
  be shown. Add a `@include scrollbars(BACKGROUND-COLOUR);` with an
  appropriate replacement for `BACKGROUND-COLOUR` to the fitting selector in
  the SCSS files. When searching for `@include scrollbars` you can find [an
  example for this in the source code of
  `pc-nrfconnect-shared`](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfconnect-shared/blob/cef186fcc4631d6c737ce4c5d299fef53a0ffcc2/src/Device/DeviceSelector/DeviceList/device-list.scss#L7).

## 4.8.8
### Fixed
- Fixed installation failure in local apps.

## 4.8.7
### Changed
- Made the device picker, sidepanel, and log UI elements optional.

## 4.8.6
### Changed
- Updated confirmation dialog style.

## 4.8.5
### Fixed
- The remote property on the electron mock was noch mocked correctly.
### Changed
- Render all panes of the App, but only the current is visible.

## 4.8.4
### Added
- Favorite and nickname in device selector for new design.
- Exported array bleChannels to provide a list of all BLE channels and some
  convenience properties on it.
### Changed
- Disabled the ESLint rule `react/require-default-props`.
- Updated the new design in many details.
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- Remove local overrides for the ESLint rule `react/require-default-props` and
  also reconsider using defaultProps when not really needed.

## 4.8.3
### Changed
- Updated Google Analytics account and set IP as anonymized.

## 4.8.2
### Fixed
- The mock fix in 4.8.1 broke mocks in another way. 🤦‍♂️

## 4.8.1
### Fixed
- Added missing mocks for nrf-device-lister and nrf-device-setup to jest config.

### Changed
- Updated dependencies.
- Removed mocking *.less files from the jest configuration, as we do not use them.

## 4.8
### Changed
- Create and connect store in App component, so this does not need to be done
  in each app (unless they want to do it themselves).
- New design for apps using the new app architecture.
- Update many dependencies.
- Turned `react`, `react-dom` and `react-redux` into peerDependencies.
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- Add `react`, `react-dom` and `react-redux` to your dev dependencies (you can
  omit any you do not strictly need, but most projects need all of them). Usually
  the easiest way to do this is by running `npm install --save-dev --save-exact
  react react-redux react-dom`.
- The linting rules were slightly strengthened so often some new errors pop up
  there. Many can be auto fixed, so run `npm run lint -- --fix` first and then
  review the changes made as well as the remaining issues.
- Also run the tests and check whether something needs to be corrected (e.g.
  because jest was updated). E.g. in the BLE app, references to
  `require.requireActual` needed to be corrected to `jest.requireActual`.

## 4.7
### Changed
- Add a few peer dependencies.

## 4.6
### Added
- Enable to send user data.

## 4.5
### Added
- Enable to publish existing artifact instead of packing from source.

## 4.4
- Update Jest.

## 4.3
### Added
- Ease configuration of git hooks.
### Steps to upgrade when using this package
- If you want to automatically run the `lint` and `test` scripts before pushing
  changes, add a file `.huskyrc.json` to your project with this content:
  ```json
  {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-push": "bash node_modules/pc-nrfconnect-shared/scripts/pre-push.sh"
    }
  }
  ```
  Remember that in a case of emergency you can do `git push --no-verify` if you need to push even though tests might fail.

## 4.2
### Changed
- Enhanced handling custom devices.
- Remove dependency of react-infinite.

## 4.1
### Changed
- Enhanced error dialogs:
    - Made URLs in error messages clickable (and more generally interpret them as markdown).
    - Made error messages selectable again (regression) to enable copy&pasting them.
    - Enabled custom error resolutions.

## 4.0
### Changed
- This package was renamed to “pc-nrfconnect-shared”. If you refer to it anywhere under
  the old name (e.g. in a package.json or import a component from it) then you must
  update these references when upgrading to version 4.

## 3.6
### Changed
- Moved the shared components from core to this project (They can now be used by importing
  “pc-nrfconnect-devdep”).
- Provide a babel config for apps, instead of requiring them to provide one themselves.

## 3.5
### Added
- Possibility to use the new architecture through “nrfconnect/shared”.
### Changed
- Updated dependencies.

## 3.4
### Added
- Internal publishing.

## 3.3
### Added
- Upload Changelog.md of apps when publishing.

## 3.2
### Changed
- Switch from node-sass to dart-sass.

## 3.1
### Changed
- Updated many dependencies.

## 3.0
### Changed
- Updated dependencies, most notably Bootstrap to 4.
### Added
- lint-init.
- electronMock.
