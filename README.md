# Shared commodities for developing nRF Connect for Desktop

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/NordicSemiconductor/Wayland/_apis/build/status/pc-nrfconnect-shared?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/NordicSemiconductor/Wayland/_build/latest?definitionId=31&branchName=master)

This project provides shared commodities for developing nRF Connect for Desktop
apps and their launcher:

-   React components
-   Build scripts
-   Configurations
-   Test facilities

## Developing a new feature or fixing an error

Whenever something is changed in pc-nrfconnect-shared, an entry should be added
to `Changelog.md`.

If there is no latest entry there yet, and you do not intend to release the
change as a new version right ahead, add a new section with the heading
`## Unreleased` at the top.

## Releasing

To release, two files must be up-to-date:

-   `package.json` contain the correct version number (one more than the last
    release).
-   `Changelog.md` must contain an entry, with that version number and today's
    date.

By running `npm run prepare-shared-release` you update the version in
`package.json` and in `Changelog.md` a potential `## Unreleased` heading is
updated to the right version and todayâ€˜s date.

When those conditions are met, a new release of shared will automatically be
created when the according PR is merged into main.
